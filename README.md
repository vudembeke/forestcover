#  Forest Cover Prediction System

This project focuses on predicting future forest cover using **machine learning** and **computer vision** techniques.  
By combining satellite imagery with historical climate data, the system aims to detect, analyze, and forecast forest cover changes for better environmental monitoring and decision-making.

##  Features
- Uses **LSTM** and **GRU** deep learning models to predict forest cover trends from historical climate data.  
- Applies **NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index)** to assess vegetation health.  
- Implements **U-Net segmentation** to classify land cover (forests, crops, plantations).  
- Utilizes **Change Vector Analysis (CVA)** for vegetation and forest change detection over time.  
- Stores prediction results in a database for future retrieval and analysis.  
- Provides a user-friendly interface for querying forest cover data.
